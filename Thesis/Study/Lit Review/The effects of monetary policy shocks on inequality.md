## Abstract

They constructed a measure of unanticipated changes in policy rates for a penal of 32 advanced and emerging market countries for the period between 1990 and 2013.
They conclusion is that contractionary monetary actions (increases in interest rates) increase income inequality. The other way is also verified: expansionary monetary policies can reduce income inequality.
The effect is not homogeneous across time and depends also from the type of the shock, the economy status (whether in expansion or recession), depends on the share of labor income and redistribution policies.

## Some remarks

In the introduction, they mention the increasing attention that the effect of monetary policy on inequality has gain over the last years.
The studies reach different conclusions and this is coherent with the idea that there are different channels throught monetary policy affects people.

* Expansionary policy can increase inequality because lower interest rates can lead to the increase in the inflation rate;
* Expansionary policy can increase inequality because lower interest rates lead to inscrease in the assets prices; 
* Expansionary policy can reduce inequality through savings redistribution: when the interest rate is lower, the borrowers (usually the ones with higher marginal propensity to consume, the poorer people) will benefit more than the people who are lending money;
* Expancionary policy can reduce inequality because is creates a stimulus in the economy, increasing employment and salaries.

**I really don't get** what they are saying in pag 9 about the shocks. What's the meaning of _"This metodology overcomes two problems that may confound the causal estimation of the effect of monetary policy shocks on inequality"_?
They argue that is necessary to use "exogenous" monetary policy shocks (pag 8).
