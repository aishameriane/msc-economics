## My questions

1. What's the difference between conventional and non-conventional monetary policy shocks?
**Some thoughts**: [This paper](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/sheedy/papers/ConventionalAndUnconventionalMPRules.pdf) says _An unconventional policy instrument is defined as any instrument of the central bank that does not depend for its operation on changing
the risk-free nominal interest rate now or in the future. This includes several types of balancesheet policies where the central bank purchases assets (for example, quantitative easing or credit easing), emergency lending, and subsidized access to central-bank credit. Unconventional policy as defined also includes ‘macroprudential’ policy instruments that place restrictions on borrowing
independently of interest rates_. Não entendi como que o BC pode fazer algo sem que isso reflita na taxa de juros nominal (se é que a ideia é essa).

2. What's the meaning of _100 basis points reduction in policy rates_?
** Some thoughts**: Check the [original article](https://academic.oup.com/ser/article-abstract/12/2/245/1666588) from Huber and Stephens.

## Abstract

They constructed a measure of unanticipated changes in policy rates for a penal of 32 advanced and emerging market countries for the period between 1990 and 2013.
They conclusion is that contractionary monetary actions (increases in interest rates) increase income inequality. The other way is also verified: expansionary monetary policies can reduce income inequality.
The effect is not homogeneous across time and depends also from the type of the shock, the economy status (whether in expansion or recession), depends on the share of labor income and redistribution policies.

## Some remarks

In the introduction, they mention the increasing attention that the effect of monetary policy on inequality has gain over the last years.
The studies reach different conclusions and this is coherent with the idea that there are different channels throught monetary policy affects people.

* Expansionary policy can increase inequality because lower interest rates can lead to the increase in the inflation rate;
* Expansionary policy can increase inequality because lower interest rates lead to inscrease in the assets prices; 
* Expansionary policy can reduce inequality through savings redistribution: when the interest rate is lower, the borrowers (usually the ones with higher marginal propensity to consume, the poorer people) will benefit more than the people who are lending money;
* Expancionary policy can reduce inequality because is creates a stimulus in the economy, increasing employment and salaries.

**I really don't get** what they are saying in pag 9 about the shocks. What's the meaning of _"This metodology overcomes two problems that may confound the causal estimation of the effect of monetary policy shocks on inequality"_ 
They argue that is necessary to use "exogenous" monetary policy shocks (pag 8).

## Introduction

Their argument starts stating that the role of monetary policy on inequality is an open issue. Inequality has been extensively studied including its relation with other economic variables, such as:
* Technological progress (Bound and Johnson, 1002; Acemoglu, 2002);
* Demographics (Karahan and Ozkan, 2013);
* Globalization (Feenstra and Hanson, 1999; Furceri and Loungani, 2018);
* Labor market structure (Jaumotte and Osorio Buitron, 2015).

As said, the interaction between the monetary policy and inequality is not clear, but some authors made some contributions in the last years:
* Accomodative monetary policy [[def 1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/accomodativemonetarypolicy.asp)] [[def 2](http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/accommodative-monetary-policy.html)] in many advanced economies since the onset of the Great Recession may have negatively affected income and wealth distribution ([Acemoglu and Johnson, 2012](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/who-captured-the-fed/); Stieglitz, 2015 [[link 1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9781137554543_1)], [[link 2](http://www.nber.org/papers/w21191)]).
* On other hand, other authors found evidences of inequality reduction due to lower interest rates, because expansionary monetary policy has an effect in the employment (throught the expansion in investments, I suppose) (Draghi, 2016)

So, their conclusion is that there are competitive views about the subject (impact of conventional/unconventional monetary policy on inequality) and this is due to the existance of many different transmission channels (the transmission channels I'll discuss in my review from Auclert, 2017). Simplifying, we have this theoretical results:

* Inflation and asset prices go up when the interest rates go down (expansionary policy) - well, in the case of asset prices we have to take a deeper lool into the household portfolio composition to understand the effect - increasing inequality;
* Borrowers can benefit from low interest rates, since, well, they will take credit at a lower price at the same time the lenders will loose money, which can decrease inequality;
* Workers benefit from expansionary monetary because the investment tend to increase, increasing production, employment and wages.

Empirically, what has been observed up until now is also controverse, in the sense that the findings about the effects of monetary policy on income distribution are modest (and sometimes with different signs) and vary across countries:

* Coibion et al, 2012 [[Working Paper, 2012](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18170)], [[article, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393217300466)][my notes] - they found that in the US [contractionary monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractionary-policy.asp) increases inequality. Their findings suggests that households with high earnings (above the 90th percentile) earn about 4% more labor income after an increase in the interest rates while the labor income for low-earning households (the 10th percentile) declined by 4% in the long run.
* [Guerello, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560617302280) - found similar results but for the Euro area.
* O'Farrell et al (2016) [[article, 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/infi.12108)] [[working paper, 2016](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/monetary-policy-and-inequality_5jm2hz2x9hxr-en)] [my notes] - their analisys on the financial redistribution channel concludes that the effect of monetary policy through the financial channel is small and varies across OCDE countries: lowering the interest rate in 1% increase the Gini coefficient by up to 0.02% after 3 years **For future Aisha: go get this paper** 
* [Huber and Stephens (2014)](https://academic.oup.com/ser/article-abstract/12/2/245/1666588) - 100 basis point reduction in policy rates (**Aisha**: remember to check what's the meaning of this) implies in a reduction in Gini index of 0.4%.
* [Bivens (2015)](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Josh_Bivens_Inequality_FINAL.pdf) - "argues that expansionary monetary policy could reduce inequality if the economy is close to full employment, but that the relative distributional effects of recent FED policy actions are small.
* Saiki and Frost (2014) [[article, 2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2014.962229)] [[working paper, 2014](https://www.dnb.nl/binaries/Working%20Paper%20423_tcm46-307334.pdf)] - expansionary unconventional monetary policy in japan is related to augmented inequality levels.
* Casiraghi et al (2016) [[article, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560617302292)], [[working paper, 2016](https://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/temi-discussione/2016/2016-1077/en_tema_1077.pdf)] - "find that recent monetary policy measures have a negligible overall effect on inequality in Italy".
