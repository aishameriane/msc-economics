* They wanted to fill the gaps between the first edition in 2000 and this edition, launched almost 15 years later. They compiled the actual understanding of the extent, causes and consequences of inequality as complementary to the first volume.

## Monetary inequality

* "_Even limiting attention to economic inequality, there are many interpretations and
careful distinctions have to be drawn. It is convenient to first make a distinction between
monetary and nonmonetary inequality. The former, refers to standard dollar-valued
magnitudes associated with the economic activity of an individual or a household (earnings, income, consumption expenditures, and wealth). Nonmonetary inequality, also
referred to here as “beyond income” inequality, addresses broader dimensions of economic life such as well-being or capability_".
* "_Restricting inequality to monetary magnitudes does not prevent confusion. In the media,
one often hears statements like “the wealth of the richest x billionaires would feed all the poor in a particular country.” But this confuses wealth, which is a stock, with income or
consumption, which are flows. Flows have to be specified as occurring over a certain
period, so that the figures for overall inequality in Figure 1a relate to annual income. Wealth is in contrast measured at a point in time._"
	* "_If billionaires gave away all their wealth this year to feed poor families, then they would not appear in the Forbes list next year. If, on the other hand, they gave away the income from their wealth, then the gift would be smaller but they could go on doing it year after year._"
* They also distinguish between **income** and **earnings**.
		* **Earnings** is only part of income and usually are related to those reveived as compensation for work and does not accounts inequality of income among pensioners or unemployed (they refer to chap 18 to elucidate between the two concepts).
		* **Earnings** usually refers to individuals and income traditionally refers to households (i.e., someone unemployed can live with the wages from its family).
* The literature usually employs the Gini Index to refer as the overall inequality.
* The authors highlight the historical importance to the functional income distribution among labor, land and capital given by classical economists and criticize that saying that this implicitly assumes that the society is divided between classes that derive their income from different factors.
