ReferÃªncia completa: ALVAREDO, Facundo et al. Global inequality dynamics: New findings from WID. world. American Economic Review, v. 107, n. 5, p. 404-09, 2017.

## Questions

* **1. What are quoted and unquoted equity?**

## Main idea of the paper

They present a brief history of the WID project (http://wid.world/) followed by the analysis of recent data for selected countries (U.S., China, France, U.K., Japan, Germany).

## Some pieces

* They observed a general increase in the ratio of the net private wealth and national income for the countries over the past decades and the pattern didn't suffered changes when looking into the 2008's period (the financial crisis).
		* This is due to several factors, divided in volume factors and relative asset prices and institutional factors.
		* Another aspect is the transfer com public wealth to private wealth, which was specially high in China. If there is no public wealth, then the government cannot directly redistribute and need other redistribution methods.
* They talk about the lack of data as something that can compromise the analysis.
* The rise of top wealth shares in U.S can be explained, at least partially, by the high income inequality and bottom income stagnation that exist in the country;
* In China, there was an unequal process of privatization and access to quoted and unquoted equity (what is this?)
* In France and U.K. there was a large increase in the real state prices relatevely to stock prices.
