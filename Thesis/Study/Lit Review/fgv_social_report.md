## Intro

I decided to read this to have a better understanding about the Brazil's data on distribution of income and poverty. Here I'm just writing some facts (the report is just 6 page long) that maybe I can use later.
They are using data from PNAD, which are in microdata format - to start digging that thing now would give me little benefit for my research.
It would be nice to find a published article or working paper with similar data.

## Highlights

* In 2015, Brazil's poverty rate rise 19.3%, meaning that there were 3.6 new million people living in poverty;
* The author's calculations show that from the end of 2014 until the end of 2016, the rise in poverty was 33%, which implicates a climb from 8.38% to 11.18% of the Brazilians living in poverty (Brazil's population is approximately 200 million people) - about 23 million people were living in poverty by the end of 2017.
* As cut-off to define poverty, the authors are considering 233 BLR per month (in August, 2018);
* Here they have a nice graph with the evolution of poverty in Brazil and some corresponding media coverage:

* In the second part, they try to answer the question: "Why did poverty rise?" _Obs: I don't think this was completely answered_
    * Their first graph compares the trend in the labor income (in terms of growth) and inequality (o think it's Gini - it's not clear what are the measures there);
        * The mean income rose in the first part of 2014 and then started to decline, reaching its lower point in 2016.
        * There was a rising in average income starting in the end of 2016, but equality remained low (still not sure how this was calculated).
        * The % refers to the 12-month variation.
        * For me it is not clear that the decline in wages was the responsible. Although both wages and equality dropped simultaneously, they did not recover together, bringing the question whether there is a lagged relationship in upward trend or if the two things are not that correlated.
    * The second graph has the monthly Gini index (probably for income) from 2012 to 2018. 
        * There was a sharp rise starting in the middle of 2014. But this is not so sharp if we consider the graph scale: minimum is 0.560 and maximum is 0.595. I think that something else should be considered to understand what a .03 in Gini represents.
* In the third part, they asks "Who loose more?"
    * The fourth graph has data for selected groups and the income growth rate from 2015 to 2018;
        * There was a decline in aggregated income (considering all groups) of 3.44%;
        * The only group with a sufficiently large rise in income is "spouse". My guess is that a lot of spouses that were not working at all had to go to the market because the salary of the head of the family alone was not enough to provide for everyone - putting in other terms, this rise is just masking the phenomena of the lower wages of the main source of income in the house;
        * The group with the most severe drop in income for the period was the youngers between 15 to 19 years.
    * The fifth graph makes the same analysis, but only for the growth in income between 2014 and 2015
        * All grouphs had experienced shrinkage in their income of at least 5%, the most affected group was the one with younger people
* Fourth part asks "Why it was like this?" or "Why it got worse?"
    * The easiest answer is _unemployment_;
    * The income started to rise again if desinflation;
    * Accordingly to the authors, the unemployment accounts for 3.99% of the loss in income (to be honest I didn't understand what they tried to say by: _Olhando para o período 2015 a 2018, o desemprego explica 3.99% da queda de renda contra 3.44% da totalidade da queda da renda. Em suma, o desemprego foi o principal responsável pela queda de poder de compra das famílias brasileiras, representando no último ponto uma queda de 1.9% na renda ou de 1.38% se adicionarmos o efeito aumento da participação no mercado de trabalho".
    * The most astouning data is that the mean income dropped 7% in 2015 but if we look to the loss of income among the 5% poorest, it was about 14%;
        * One explanation was the lack of rise in the Bolsa Familia program, while inflation and unemployment were exploding;
    * Their conclusion was that the crisis effect among the poors was much worse than it was for the general population.
