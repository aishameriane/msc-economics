* ADAM, Klaus; TZAMOURANI, Panagiota (2016) [[my notes](https://github.com/aishameriane/msc-economics/edit/master/Thesis/Study/Lit%20Review/distributional-conseq-asset-prices.md)] - Unexpected fall in the interest rates by the monetary authority benefits the households in the top 5% of the wealth distribution. They gain five times more than the others and simmetrically, when interest rates rise, they loose 5 times more as well.

* Auclert (2017) [[working paper](http://www.nber.org/papers/w23451)] - Impact of monetary policy on inequality goes through 5 redistribution channels and will depend on the assets portfolio composition and maturity. When the monetary authority makes a monetary expansion, families whose liabilities have more duration than their assets will benefit (because they can negotiate new credit at lower rates). 

* [Bivens (2015)](https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Josh_Bivens_Inequality_FINAL.pdf) - "argues that expansionary monetary policy could reduce inequality if the economy is close to full employment, but that the relative distributional effects of recent FED policy actions are small.

* Casiraghi et al (2016) [[article, 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560617302292)], [[working paper, 2016](https://www.bancaditalia.it/pubblicazioni/temi-discussione/2016/2016-1077/en_tema_1077.pdf)] - "find that recent monetary policy measures have a negligible overall effect on inequality in Italy".

* Coibion et al, 2012 [[Working Paper, 2012](http://www.nber.org/papers/w18170)], [[article, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304393217300466)][my notes] - they found that in the US [contractionary monetary policy](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractionary-policy.asp) increases inequality. Their findings suggests that households with high earnings (above the 90th percentile) earn about 4% more labor income after an increase in the interest rates while the labor income for low-earning households (the 10th percentile) declined by 4% in the long run. the policy of diminishing interest rates increased the asset prices (which benefited the shareholders). At the same time, when the interest rates are lower, there are an increase in inflation rates, which penalize the individuals with more liquid assets (in general, the ones with lower income and wealth).

* Dopke and Schneider (2006) [[article](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1162/jeea.2006.4.2-3.493)] - Found a similar effect as Coibion, in which expansionary policy favors borrowers. They focused

* Galbraith (1998) [[article](https://njfac.org/index.php/with-economic-inequality-for-all/)] - strict inflation target was responsible for causing recessions and decrease in the empoyment rates which prompted to increase in inequality;

* [Guerello, 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0261560617302280) - found similar results but for the Euro area.

* [Huber and Stephens (2014)](https://academic.oup.com/ser/article-abstract/12/2/245/1666588) - 100 basis point reduction in policy rates (**Aisha**: remember to check what's the meaning of this) implies in a reduction in Gini index of 0.4%.

* O'Farrell et al (2016) [[article, 2017](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/infi.12108)] [[working paper, 2016](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/economics/monetary-policy-and-inequality_5jm2hz2x9hxr-en)] [my notes] - their analisys on the financial redistribution channel concludes that the effect of monetary policy through the financial channel is small and varies across OCDE countries: lowering the interest rate in 1% increase the Gini coefficient by up to 0.02% after 3 years **For future Aisha: go get this paper** 

* Saiki and Frost (2014) [[article, 2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2014.962229)] [[working paper, 2014](https://www.dnb.nl/binaries/Working%20Paper%20423_tcm46-307334.pdf)] - expansionary unconventional monetary policy in japan is related to augmented inequality levels.
