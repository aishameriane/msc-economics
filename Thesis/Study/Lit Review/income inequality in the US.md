## Abstract

They present data series on top shares of income and wages for a period ranging from 1913 to 1998 in the U.S.. They used tax returns data.
Top income and wages display a U-shaped pattern (contrary to Kuznets curve).

## Introduction

- They start talking about the inverted U from Kuznets
- One thing worth investigating is whether the increase in inequality is due to the rise of a "new" U curve or the Kuznets curve does not holds at all for this period
- Main contributions:
    1. Construction of an annual series of shares of total income (with subgroups of income whithin the top decile);
    2. For each group they presented the share of each sourve of income (wages, business income, capital income);
    3. They compiled wage data from IRS.
    4. They stress out that their main contribution is to provide a new series on income and wage inequality.
- Main results:
    1. They found a U-shape format for the top shares series (suggesting "a pure Kuznets mechanism cannot fully account the facts");
    2. Top capital incomes suffered more from the shocks from last century (for example, the war dizimated stuff);
    3. They found out that although wage shares were stable from 1920-1940, its level declined during the second War, to start a recovery in the late 1960s and reach higher values than before the decline.
        * This implies that the increase in top income shares in the last three decades is the direct consequence in the surge in top wages.
        * There were a substitution in the top income groups: the riches, which used to have capital income, now are the ones with higher salaries.

## Data characteristics

- Before 1944, many people were exempted from the tax payments (over income), thus the analysis is restricted to the top decile of the income distribution;
- The data was gathered from tax records, therefore their sample unit is "tax unit", which is a married couple living together (with dependents) or a single adult (who can also have dependents).
    * If we think about income distribution being the same among tax units as it is between individuals, then their analysis could be extended to top shares based on individuals.
- The tax units that form the top indome decile are high heterogenous whithin this group: there are the high middle class families whose income is primarily from wages and and super rich people living off large fortunes.
- They created subdivisions among the top decile because it is very heterogenous.
  
## Results

### Trends in top income shares

- The income share of the top decile of tax units from 1917 to 1998 is U-shaped.
- The share of the top decile ranged from 40 to 45% during the interwar period and had a heavy decline reaching 30% during WWII. It remained flat around 31% until the 1970s, when started to rise again.
- From 1990 to now, it has been steadily increasing and, at the time of the article, was almost in pre war levels.
- Evidence suggests that the twentieth century decline in inequality took place in a very specific and brief time interval, contradicting Kuznets theory.
- The smooth increase in inequality in the last three decades is probably more related to changes in the demand and supply for factors.
- An interesting fact is that the top percent of income suffered more losses in its income share during the war.

### The secular decline of top capital incomes

- The share of wage income is a declining function of income and the share of capital income (dividens, interest, rents and royalties) is an increasing function of income (_They mention in te article that this was "expected"... why?_ Ahm, yes, they are saying that if we plot the income on x axis and share of wages on y axis, we will have a negative line, because richer people tend to rely on another sources of income than labor)
- There was an important change in the top decile composition. Before the WWII this group was mainly formed by rent seekers, whose income were provenient from wealth holdings. On other hand, in 1998 more than half of the taxpayers in the top percentiles had income derived from wages and salaries.
- The decline of top capital incomes does not means that there was a decline in the share of capital in the economy as a hole. What happened was a redistribution of the income derived from capital.

(I skipped the part talking about taxation)

### Top Wage Shares

- Labor income inequality would differ from their wage inequality because self-employment os not included in the wage series.
