# Econonomia da Desigualdade

These are my notes from Piketty's 2015 book, _A Economia da Desigualdade_ (portuguese translation from _L'économie des inégalités_). 
Although in Portuguese, I'm making an effort to write the notes in English (one needs to train in order to become good in doing something).

## Mains Ideas

The book is relatively small (144 p) and, for me, appears to be an spin-off from _The Capital in XXI Century_ (same author). 
Maybe I'll change my mind later, but seems like it is going further in some open questions that were briefly discussed in the _Capital_.

## Chapters

### Intro

The book starts stating that income and redistribution are intrinsic related in political conflicts. 
For the author, the discrepancies in (left and right) views exist not because they don't agree on _"what is social justice"_ but also because they have different opinions on _what are the economical and social mechanisms that generate inequality_.
This question is crucial to address the best course of action: if the inequality arise from factors that can't be controlled by the individuals, like the family's initial dotation or luck, it is necessary that the government help those with less opportunities. The real issue arise in the way this intervention should be done.

One way to promote redistribution is the market way: if the markets are free to operate, in one way or another we expect to have the best allocation, or the most efficient allocation, in the sense that it is impossible to make someone better without bringing another to a worse situation. But we must question ourselves if the markets are really making the best choices. It is completely possible that imperfections lead the economy to a state where the allocation is not optimal, which in theory allows us to redistribute and make everyone better off (or, at least, make someone better without worsening other's condition).
The first way is called _pure redistribution_, where the markets are free to find an equilibrium; the second is known as _efficient redistribution_.

### Chap 1 - Measuring inequality and its evolution

The first challenge is to measure inequality over space and time. We shall start with the picture (inequality in a specific time) and then analyze the movie (inequality across time). It is possible, as well, to investigate a third dimension: the space, i.e., inequality considering different economies.
For France, we have the following data, comparing the families' income fraction due to different sources (labor, wages, retirement savings, etc) and comparing families from different income percentiles.

#### 1.1 Different types of income

In general, we have the following:

* On average, almost 65% of the total income is from labor;
* Social transfers represents, on average, 30% of families income;
* The last category is patrimonial income (probably from investments? Dunno...).

When we divide the families accordingly to the income percentiles, we have different outcomes: while the 10% poorer families have the majority of its income comming from transferes (34,2%) and only 17,9% of its income is due to wages, the 10% richer have 68,6% of its income due to wages and only 5,6% due to transfers.

Now I have to make a small parenthesis to explain two different concepts (that took me a while to understand):

* We have the quantiles, which represents fractions of the population. For example, we can order the families using their income as criteria. Then, we take the 10% poorer, the 10% that came after and so on. Inside each group, we can calculate the average income. So, when I say _"the 10% poorer has 17,9% of their income comming from wages"_ this means that, after ordering all families using their income, taking the lower 10% and taking the wage's average participation on income from these individuals, I found 17,9%.
* We have the notion of _income limit_ (this one is trickier to understand, but hang in there), which stabilishes the income "frontier" between one quantile and another. For example, p90 is the upper income limit where 90% of the families receive that value or less. 

Sounds equal, but one is the average between the group and the other is the limit that separates groups.

Back to France's data, "most part of the families in the first decile are formed by retired workers and unemployed people: their wages represents only 18% of their total income and they live mostly from social security. The fraction of wages on income increases when we start looking the families in higher deciles.
The decline stops when we reach the 5% richer (p95-p100): their income comes from patrimonial and other labor sources (like when you are a private doctor and doesn't have wage).

*I'm still having trouble on how to interpret p95-p100... the book calls "the 5% richer", but how this is different from d95d100? Both are the 5% richers...* (maybe I need another human being to discuss out loud).

#### 1.2 Wage inequality

Since the wages are the majority of the families' income, let's take a better look on it. The second table on the book contains information about full time emplyees' wages. 
The wage distribution is very skewed, because we have few people with very high wages. This can be seen comparing the mean salary (1700) with the median salary (1400). 50% of the workers receive up to 1.400 euros, but on average, all workers received 1.700. This happens because there are outliers with higher wages. Another way to see that is to note the difference between the salary of the 10 decil (4.030) and the cutoff for the 10% higher earnings (2.720). This means that, on average, the 10% with higher wages receives 4.030 euros but the line that separates them from the rest starts on 2.720. Put on other way, people who has a salary higher than 2.720 is among the 10% with the highest wages. But this 10% on average receives 4.030 euros.

A measure of inequality is how much you need to receive to be among the 10% richers in comparison to the maximum you could receive to be considered among the 10% poorers. In France this quantity was 2.720/900, meaning that the 10% richests received almost 3 times the wages from someone in the first tenth.
This measure can be calculated for different countries. In the book we have data from OCDE countries and the range is from 2 (Norway) to 4.5 (United States).

#### 1.3 Income inequality

Income inequality across families is hard to obtain, because we need to find out about other sources of income that aren't due to wages. For France, the income inequality is higher than wages inequality, and this is a stylized fact that can be observed in other economies as well.
The first cause is due to patrimony: it is well known that the distribution of the assets like houses, firms, etc, is unequal among population. This uneven distribution cannot be accounted only by the differences in income, for example, we know that some groups had historically more access to have land leading to more inequality. Thus, several studies about inequality restrict themselves to analyze income and wages inequality.

There is another (and major) reason to income inequality being higher than wages: most poorer families that lives on small pensions are formed by one person, while higher income families are formed by couples (usually with double income) with kids. So, in order to obtain a better measure, we should adjust the income by number of family members.
The author argues that adjusting for income taxes and family sizes, we should obtain a p90/p10 relation from income very similar to the one calculated using wages.

It is a challenge to compare p90/p10 measures across countries due to accounting discrepancies in the registers. One study is reported in the book and the results are similar to the wages's inequality, although a little higher: the values range from 2.7 to 5.9.

#### 1.4 Inequality over space and time

The next big question is if this differences are stable over time. The comparison is tricky, because the consume habits tend to change. 
Abstracting this, Piketty's conclusion is that _"the inequality between the 10% richers and the 10% poorers from a country, which can be measured by a p90/p10 ratio of 3-4, is about two to three times inferior to the inequality from the end of XIX and XX centuries."_
He then proceeds to make an historical analysis and discuss briefly the Kuznet's curve: Kuznet said the inequality is an inverted U shape function, that escalated during the industrial revolution, would enter in an stagnation phase and then decline. But what we are seeing now, after the 80's, is an increase in inequality on ocidental countries, challenging Kuznet theory. For example, the p90/p10 wage ratio in the United Stated increased 20% from 1970 to 1980 and then increased more 20% in the next decade. Piketty then proceeds to discuss about the result for income and concludes that the escalation in wage inequality also happened with income inequality. He concludes saying _"The Kuznets courve in indeed dead"_ =(
There is just one addendum: it is a crude oversimplification to treat income inequality trajectory as wage inequality trajectory: one reason to have clusters of income is the fact that people look for similar person to get married. So, rich people tends to marry rich people and so on. Plus, single mother families tend to have lower income (note from Aisha: I really don't like the term "single mother" because your marital status should not interfere with your parent status. but the book is using this and I'll keep this way... for now).

#### Final remarks

He finishes this chapter walking about work inequality and emphasizes that even though some countries have lower income inequality, this could be masked due to government transferes: unemployed people could be living on social security and this could alleviate the p90/p10 ratio.
