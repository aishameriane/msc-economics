I'll just let here the main points that caught my attention.

## Intro

* They discuss the combination between heterogeneous agent models (HAM), nominal rigidities and aggregate shocks;
* One of thei opening lines is that HAMs were mostly used when investigatig consumption, savings, inequality, redistributive policies, economic mobility and "other cross-sectional phenomena", while studies involving the business cycle fluctuations relied heavly on representative agent models;
    * This was challenged by the Great Recession, originated in the housing and credit markets;
    * Portfolio composition, credit liquidity, marginal propensities to consume, unemployment risk and inequality played a central role explaining the GR;
* They compare a Representative Agent New Keynesian Model (RANK) with an Heterogenous Agent New Keynesian Model (HANK).
* **Main conclusions**
    * The similarities between RANK and HANK depend on the nature of the shocks;
        * When there is a change in household discount factors that gives place to a shock in demand, both models produce similar results, same goes for technology shocks;
        * On other hand, the models leads to different aggregate results considering fiscal and monetary shocks:
            * They explain this result stating that household consumption is more suscetible to income fluctuations than interest rates changes in HANK than in RANK;
    * Some effects can only be analyzed from the HANK perspective, such as demand shocks resulting from the hability to get credit, for example.
    
    ## Heterogeneity and Business Cycles in Macroeconomics, so Far
    
    * Basically, to estimate a model with heterogeneous agents and rational expectations is cumbersome.

    ### Inequality
    
   Heterogeneous agents models help to understand the role of inequality in the transmission of monetary policy but can be used to make the analisys the other way round as well.
   
   They use a two-asset HANK model and concluded that the effects on the consume in wealthy agents and the households in the lower deciles of wealthy will be contraty to each other and the overall effect in agreggated consumption will be a combination of these two types of households. In their specific model, a constractionary policy lead to a small increment in consumption (in line with the findings from Coibion, Gorodnichenko, Kueng and Silvia (2017)).
