## Intro

In this paper, Mishkin goes through four key monetary polity transmission channels. The goal is to discuss how monetary policy can affect the economy.
He starts with some anedcdotal data from US. By the end of the 70s, it is said that the  high inflation rate was related, among other factors, to a overly loose monetary policy. Under Volker's administration, the FED reaction of raising the interest rate threw the economy into a recession. At the middle of the 80s, the rise in interest caused the economy to slow down due to exchange rates. Later on, in early 90s, lowering the interest rate helped the economy to rise and recover from the last decade, as well as helped to lower the exchange rate. When the inflation once again was entering a rising trajectory, the interest rates went up, due to the FED's decision.

_"Monetary policy is a powerful tool, but one that sometimes has unexpected or unwanted consequences"_.

The message Tobin wants to spread is that in order to monetary policy be successful, the monetary autority needs to understand well the transmission mechanisms through which monetary policy affects the economy, in order to better assess the timming and effect of its actions. 

## Interest rate channel

The most classical transmission channel, present in any textbook. The flow can be described as follows:

1. A contracionist monetary shock
2. Raises the real interest rate 
3. Which raises the capital cost, lowering investment spending (since you can earn more if you let your money invested in financial applications instead buying more machinery)
4. This lowers the aggregate demand ([Keynes interest rate effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynes_effect)) and consequently the diminish of output.

The interest rate channel considers that the investment is a result of both firms and households, because the latter decides on consumption expending on durable goods and housing.

Although it is considered a vanilla textbook transmission channel, there is no consensus on the magnitude of the effect it excerces on the economy.

## Exchange rate channel

In the cases where there is no exchange rate anchor (i.e. when the exchange rate is lexible), the monetary policy can affect the net exports through the exchange rate channel. The schematics is described below:

1. A contracionist monetary shock
2. Raises the real interest rate
3. People start to lookinh for dollars, which raises its price (the exchange rate is the price of dollars)
4. Since US dollars are more expensive, the United States faces a downward in exports (or a rise in imports), which lowers net exports
5. This lowers the overall output

## Other assets price effects

There is the Keynesian and the monetarist view. The first focuses on the relative price of assets and its relation with the interest rate. Monetarists, on the other hand, say that one needs to see how the monetary policy affects the universe of relative asset prices 
and the real wealth. They loath to define what are the transmission channels of monetary policy because they can change over different business cycles. However, there are two channels that appear more frequently in monetarists texts: one involving Tobin's q and another linking wealth impact over consumption.

### Tobin's q

Let's make a brief recap on Tobin's q. It is defined as follows:

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=q&space;=&space;\frac{\text{market&space;value}}{\text{replacement&space;cost&space;of&space;capital}}&space;=&space;\frac{\text{buy&space;an&space;existing&space;firm}}{\text{build&space;a&space;new&space;firm}}" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?q&space;=&space;\frac{\text{market&space;value}}{\text{replacement&space;cost&space;of&space;capital}}&space;=&space;\frac{\text{buy&space;an&space;existing&space;firm}}{\text{build&space;a&space;new&space;firm}}" title="q = \frac{\text{market value}}{\text{replacement cost of capital}} = \frac{\text{buy an existing firm}}{\text{build a new firm}}" /></a>

Tobin's q is a mechanism by which the monetary policy also affects the economy, due to its influence over equities valuation. If q is more than one, then the market price is higher than the replacement cost, meaning that the firm should issue equities to take advantage of the higher market prices. With this capital stream, it can buy new machinery, which represents new capital investment. Otherwise, when q is too low, the company has incentive to buy another firm instead making investments. 

But how this is related to monetary policy transmission? Well, accordingly to the monetarists, when there is a fall in the money suply, there is also a decrease in spending, which includes the spending in equity purchases. When the demand for equity falls, their prices fall as well. The Keynesian story has a similar conclusion, but different plot: when the interest rate rises, it becomes more interesting to buy bonds than equities, which also will be reflected in a lower value of q.

### Wealth impact over consumption

This is related to Modigliani's Life Cycle Hypothesis. The consumption spending is a result of the available resources during the life cycle, which in its turn, consists in human capital, real capital and financial wealth. Equities are one of the main components of the financial wealth, so when the equities' prices fall, the financial wealth also falls, lowering the amount of available resources to spend during the lifecycle. The consequence is a fall in consumption, which affects the output.

## Credit channel 

This channel can be subdivided between the economic agents (firms and households). Among the firms, it subdivides again into loans and balance sheets. All cases arise from the assynmetric information problems that arises in credit market.

### Firms

#### Loans (or bank lending channel)

Regarding loans, if the interest rate rises, the bank deposits will shrink, which decreases the amoung available for bank loans. With less money available for firms to get borrowed, they will make less investments as well, which ultimately will decrease the output.

#### Balance sheets

When the net worth of a firm goes down, the collateral for their loans diminishes as well, which raises the adverse selection risk for the lenders, that will have less incentives to lend their money. Ultimately, this will decreases the amount available for financial lending, diminishing the financial investment and affeting output.

Lower net worth also increases the moral hazard risk, because when the firm's net value is low, their owners might be compelled to take higher risks, since their losses will not be high. 

There is a footnote on page 8 that I find interesting. It says that when there is a fall in price level due to an unexpected monetary shock, the balance sheet mechanism will be reinforced by the pre-fixed contracts. Suppose that in time t a firm agrees to pay X at time t+2. If the price level goes down in t+1, then the firm will have a decrease in its revenue but its loan will not change its nominal value. Therefore, when the firm pays its debt, it will have the same amount of money that is needed to pay while observing a lowering in its revenues.

I'm going to put the full quote in case I need it again: _``If the contractionary monetary policy produces an anticipated decline in the price level, there is an additional reinforcement of the balance-sheed transmission mechanism. Because debt payments are contractually fixed in nominal terms, an unanticipated decline in the price level raises the value of firms' liabilities in real terms (that is, it increases the burden of the debt), but does not raise the real value of the firm's assets. Monetary contraction, which leads to an unanticipated drop in the price level, therefore reduces the real net worth and causes an increase in adverse selection and moral hazard problemsm, which cause a decline in investment spending and aggregate output along the lines of the schematic here. This is a rationalization of the debt-inflation view of the Great Depression espoused by Irving Fisher (1933).''_

### Consumers

In the case of the consumers, we have an analogous effect: the rise in intereset rate will imply less money available for consumers to take loans in order to buy durable goods and spend on housing, whilst also affecting financial flows. 

If consumers expect to be in a situation where less money available, they will most likely avoid holding iliquid assets. What happens then when the stock prices fall due to an increase in the interest rate? The financial assets will loose value and consumers will diminish their spending on durable goods and housing, which will have an impact in the output.
