## Intro

In this paper, Mishkin goes through four key monetary polity transmission channels. The goal is to discuss how monetary policy can affect the economy.
He starts with some anedcdotal data from US. By the end of the 70s, it is said that the  high inflation rate was related, among other factors, to a overly loose monetary policy. Under Volker's administration, the FED reaction of raising the interest rate threw the economy into a recession. At the middle of the 80s, the rise in interest caused the economy to slow down due to exchange rates. Later on, in early 90s, lowering the interest rate helped the economy to rise and recover from the last decade, as well as helped to lower the exchange rate. When the inflation once again was entering a rising trajectory, the interest rates went up, due to the FED's decision.

_"Monetary policy is a powerful tool, but one that sometimes has unexpected or unwanted consequences"_.

The message Tobin wants to spread is that in order to monetary policy be successful, the monetary autority needs to understand well the transmission mechanisms through which monetary policy affects the economy, in order to better assess the timming and effect of its actions. 

## Interest rate channel

The most classical transmission channel, present in any textbook. The flow can be described as follows:

1. An contracionist monetary shock
2. Lowers the real interest rate 
3. Raises the capital cost, which lowers the investment spending (since you can earn more if you let your money invested in financial applications instead buying more machinery)
4. This lowers the aggregate demand ([Keynes interest rate effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynes_effect)) and consequently the diminish of product.

The interest rate channel considers that the investment is a result of both firms and households, because the latter decides on consumption expending on durable goods and housing.

Although it is considered a vanilla textbook transmission channel, there is no consensus on the magnitude of the effect it excerces on the economy.
