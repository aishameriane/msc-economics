# 1. Benoît Cœuré

The economic growth experienced by the Countries in the Euro Area contributed to reduce poverty in the region, with a help of the newly created jobs that were created in the following years. However, the international crisis took a toll on this, increasing unemployment and leaving the economy into a deep uncertainty regarding the future.

Inequality brings social cohesion and, in the case of the EU, this is "one of the statutory objectives" of the deal. However, Monetary Policy is about stabilization, not equity or distribution.

For him, this does not imply that CB should not worry about inequality, under two arguments: 1) MP may play a role on inequality and 2) stability conduces to equity. IF the MP is sucessfull to achieving inflation control, then it would automatically contributing to diminish poverty by protecting the households who are more vulnerable to inflation.

The main point of the speech is go through these two arguments while sustaining the idea that prices stability is the best contribution that MP can do to the economy.

## Inequality/poverty is a cause for concern also in the Euro area

* It is not an easy task to determine the relationship between inequality and economic growth due to its complex characteristics
* Gini Index increased in the last years, in comparison to what it was back in the 80s looking for the aggregate data from the OECD countries
* The rise in inequality was due to the increase in top incomes, in particular wage inequality
* These trends are not uniformly when we look at individual countries alone
* Unemployment remain a main driver of inequality

## Can MP affect inequality and poverty?

* Divided in two cases: 
    * The direct redistributive effects (including those who goes through inflation channel)
    * Benefits from stable price levels
    
In the first case, we have monetary policy being transmitted by many channels. For example, when the interest rates falls and inflation rise, borrowers benefit because they will consume today when money has more purchase power at a lower price (interest). On the other hand, lenders will see their assets diminished and will receive less for not consumind today their savings (the euthanasia from the rentier, as Keynes would put).
Even though in this first situation inflation could diminish inequality, it is not advised to pursue higher price levels as monetary target. Inflation takes away purchase power from the poorest, who have their holdings predominantely in cash. Also, inflation can hurt people through the income from labour and unemployment, specially in low skill occupations.
So one hand, contractionary policy is linked to increase inequality and on the other hand, inflation (which is correlated with low interest rates) can also affect inequality.

In general, the poorest households who cannot protect themselves from adverse shocks, will suffer the most from unexpected suddenly changes.

## The role of ECB measures 

MP best contribution is stabilizing prices in a way that also leads to low volatility (due to the credibility)

# 2. Janet Yellen

* There is an increasing in income and wealth inequality in the States that was shortly paused during the 2008's financial crisis but resumed shortly after with the recovery of the financial markets;
* There will always exist some degree of inequality, however economic inequality is linked to inequality of opportunity, leading to an endless cycle of inequality. 

Using survey data from 1989 until 2013, it is possible to notice an increase in the real income from those at the top percentiles at the expense of the poorest.
Housing is an important variable to determine wealth, but not for the very rich.
After the crisis, the housing prices recovered, which decreased a little inequality resulting from the financial turmoil.
