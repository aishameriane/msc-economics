## Abstract

The paper investigates the relationship between the capital share (capital as proportion of the national income) and top personal income shares.

## Introduction

- In the last years, there were an increase in the studies about the functional income distribution, which is the distribution between capital and labor.
- There is no consense whether there is a relation between the functional income distribution and inequality in the personal income distribution.
- The authors say: _"For Thomas Piketty (2014), the connection appears to be clear: capital income is more unequally distributed than labor income, so a transfer from labor income to capital income will increase inequality"_.
- Their contributions are:
1. Present new database on historical wage and capital shares for 21 countries (for more than 70 years);
2. They analyze empirically the relationship between factor shares and income inequality.

## Analytical framework

- Capital share is defined as the share of national income distributed as capital income: interest, profits, dividend and realized capital gains.
- They talk briefly about Atkinson's model and then proceed to explain their model.
- What they did in order to assess the link between capital shares and top income shares was a linear regression (ok, panel regressions). More specifically, they estimated the following equation

Notice that we are interested in <a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\beta_1" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\beta_1" title="\beta_1" /></a> which represents the elasticity of income inequality with respect to the capital share. This means this parameter can be interpreted as the percentage increase in inequality associated with a one-percent increase in the capital share.
- After that, they estimated a more sophisticated model including fixed and time varying factors.
- They describe some data considerations.

## Main Results

- **Correlation evidence**: _The main message is that functional and personal income distributions are positively correlated_.
- **Regression coefficient**: For different groups of countries and different periods, the coefficient linking the functional income distribution to inequality is significant and positive.
- **Consistence across groups**: Since there is evidence of difference between different inequality measures (using top 1%, top 10%, etc), they changed the inequality variable and estimated again the model. The results confirm the heterogeneity in the income top carriers over to the relationship betwen the capital share and top income shares.
Even though, the relationship is still positive.

## Mechanism analysis

(here i think I'll find my argument, fingers crossed!)

- They start this part arguing that they didn't show any economic model to explain their findings (been there, done that), i.e., they need to say something about the mechanisms behind the associations found.

1. **The role of capital incomes of the top** - They say that a main finding from Piketty (2001) (they forgot to add in the references list, argh) and Piketty & Saez (2003) (same, but [this one](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/pikettyqje.pdf) was easier to find) is that "capital incomes are not only more predominant in the incomes of top earners compared to the rest of the population but that this predominance keeps growing also within the income top."
2. **Top income shares in the distributed national accounts** - The imperfect overlap between the income definitions used in the functional and personal income distributions is potentially one of the key explanations to why the link is not stronger.

They make some more observations and then conclude the article.
