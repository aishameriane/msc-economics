This folder is where I intend to save my notes on the articles and related literature that I'm studying.

# To-do

* Maybe I should organize this folder and throw my notes on a separate space, like [this one](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes);
* Write the articles I'll study next;
* Get my notes from other stuff (Uhlig?) in here;
* ~~Organize better, maybe including the link to the original work and then a link to my notes (and code, if any)~~.

## Econometric Stuff

(I gave up trying to keep up w/ all changes, so let's hope there will be "a model" at some point and "a method to estimate the model")
