**Chapter 1 - The principal problem in political economy: income distribution in the history of economic thought**

## Abstract

They cover the history of the theories of income distribution, from classical economists (considered as positive theory of income distribution) to other theories. I'm just readeing the first part for now and maybe later I can come back to this.

## Intro

* David Ricardo said:
		* _“**The produce of the earth—all that is derived from its surface by the united application of labour, machinery, and capital, is divided among three classes of the community**; namely, the proprietor of the land, the owner of the stock or capital necessary for its cultivation, and the labourers by whose industry it is cultivated. But in different stages of society, **the proportions of the whole produce of the earth which will be allotted to each of these classes, under the names of rent, profit, and wages, will be essentially different**; depending mainly on the actual fertility of the soil, on the accumulation of capital and population, and on the skill, ingenuity, and instruments employed in agriculture. To determine the laws which regulate this distribution, is the principal problem in Political Economy.”_ 
* They started saying that there is a positivist and a normative aspect of the analysis of income distribution;
		* **positivist** is related to explanations - this is where the classical economists are;
		* **normative** refers to evaluating the "distribution of income from the point of view of justice and equity"

## The positive economics of income distribution

* It is different to ask "Why are some countries rich and some poor" and "Why are some _people_ rich and some poor?".
* Note that the intensity of the question can implicit reflects to at what extend the people asking the question think of income inequality as something that can be changed.

### The classical school: factor prices and the functional distribution of income

* The classical school of economics goes back to Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill. Their ideas where dominant in the period between 1770 and 1870.
* _"Regarding the positive study of the distribution of income, the theoretical approach of the classical economists focused mainly on the functional distribution of income, i.e., the distribution of income between the main factors of production, and it was doubtless this distribution that Ricardo had in mind when he made his remark about “the principal problem.”"_
		* How the main factors are defined can change a little from author to author, but the main concepts are labor, capital and land. Their incomes are wages, profits and rent.
