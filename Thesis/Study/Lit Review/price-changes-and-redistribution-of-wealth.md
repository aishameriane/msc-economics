# Abstract

(*Note from Aisha:* _They talk more in terms of deflation effects because Euro Area had experienced a lower in price levels_).
They study the Household Finance and Consumption Survey in order to find the effects of unexpected price-level changes in the wealth distribution for various countries listed in the survey. Overall, deflation hurts the Euro Area, but some countries face more losses than others. Governments are losers while households are winners (again, there are differences when analyzing countries). 

# My skimming

They used the survey to compute measurements regarding the net nominal positions.
