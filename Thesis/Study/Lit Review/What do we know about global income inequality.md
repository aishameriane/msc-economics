# Abstract

They want to investigate the direction of the observed rise in inequality worldwide. 
They discuss the problems regarding the usage of national accounts data versus surveys. 
They couldn't find evidence of one direction or another of the rise in inequality.

# Intro

They make a review of earlier studies on global interpersonal inequality, comparing them regarding the estimation methods, data and period.
Studies included are the ones who made comparisons between countries and within country.
Their comparisons take into account the standard errors of the estimates (due to small sample size or uncertainty due to measurement errors), which lead them to conclude that it is not possible to afirm if there was an increse or decrease in inequality.

# Motivation

# Why study inequality?

1. Moral: inequality may sound unfair
2. Instrument: inequality may be helpful to expalain something else
3. Explanatory: inequality may be the consequence of some theory (the article cites "the convergence in per capita incomes across countries predicted by neoclassical growth theory or the divergence predicted by dependency theory")

# What is inequality?

According to [Milanovic](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ecj/econjl/v112y2002i476p51-92.html), there are three definitions of inequality (I didn't read this original 2002 paper, this notes are based on the one I'm summarizing here):

1. _"Inequality among countries in their levels of average per capita income"_: in this view, each country is seen as an individual;
2. _"Between country inequality"_: accounts for inequality among citzens from different countries when they represent the average per capita income from theyr country (Aisha's note: I didn't understand what's the difference between 1 and 2)
3. _"Global inequality"_: we compare people from all over the world but they represent their own income. This is the notion that the paper is using (therefore is not an aggregate).

The paper still uses another fourth definition, in which they consider the overall income whithin a country, not only per capita level (and they call this _concept zero inequality_).

Remains open the question on which measure will be used to represent income (comsumption expenditure or income). 
There is also a discussion regarding the usage of PPP exchange rates. The argument in favor is that since prices can vary greatly between different countries, PPP would be better to capture the consumption capability of the individuals. 
On other hand, since they want to measure the fourth type of inequality, which is in terms of the aggregate income of a certain country, it would be best to use the current exchange rate from the local currency to US dollars.
So, the inequality definition that they are using is _"gross national income across countries measured at market exchange rates"_.
The last remark is that the paper is adressing _relative_ inequality (comparisons) and not _overall_ inequality.

# Descriptives

## Inequality over the globe

1. Simpler layer

A very simple exercise is to divide the per capita GDP from rich countries by the per capita GDP of poor countries. 
In *1960* the per capita GDP from the twenty richest countries was *18* times higher than the per capita GDP of the 20 poorest ones.
This number was *37* in 1995 (data from the World Bank).

2. Global interpersonal inequality

The differences between people inside a country are a more complex matter. Looking at the Gini coefficients, there is no dispute that the level of inequality is high.
However, the direction of change in global inequality is an object of dispute. While some studies conclude that inequality lowered, others found that it has risen or stayed the same. This can be seen in the chart bellow :bar_chart: :

(there are other graphs and tables in the paper to support the argument)

One thing that I didn't know is that Theil indexes are more sensible to changes in the tails of the distribution when compared to Gini indexes. 

# Other remarks

The remaining of the paper has a discussion on the methods used in the papers and their implications. After, they analyze each paper and make comparisons, as well as calculate some standard errors (one of their points is that taking into account the SD, there is no consensus on the direction of the changes in inequality).

# Conclusions

* The literature can be rather obscure in describing the methods used
    * Even when the method is described, there is not enough justification to support the choice of one particular method over others
* It is not possible to reach a conclusion regarding the direction of the changes in inequality over the three decades preceeding the publication. 
* They address some possible sources of uncertainty regarding the databases and also makes some suggestions on what would be better to use.
