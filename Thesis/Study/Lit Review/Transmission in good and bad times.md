## Research question (what)
How the economic scenario affects the transmission of monetary policy and the structural shocks?

## How 
Quantile regressions

## Where
U.S. economy

## Findings
There are asymmetries in the propagation mechanism across good and bad times. When the economy is in expansion (above its long term average), the estimates of the degree of forward-lookiness and interest rate semi-elasticity are significantly larger than the estimates in recessions (below-average periods).
The findings suggests that monetary policy is mopre effective during periods of expansions.
