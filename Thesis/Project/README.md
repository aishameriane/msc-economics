Here are the files related to my project. [Seminar 1](https://github.com/aishameriane/msc-economics/tree/master/Thesis/Project/Seminar1) and [Seminar 2](https://github.com/aishameriane/msc-economics/tree/master/Thesis/Project/Seminar2) were presented during the "Seminários de dissertação e tese" course, in 2017/2. The [final draft](https://github.com/aishameriane/msc-economics/blob/master/Thesis/Project/Seminar2/Pr%C3%A9%20projeto%20Aishameriane%2028112017.pdf) of the course (like a pre-proposal) is available in Seminar 2 folder.

In the future the files of the project final form will be available here in the main repository.
