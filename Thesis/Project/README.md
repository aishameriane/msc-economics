Here are the files related to my project. [Seminar 1](https://github.com/aishameriane/msc-economics/tree/master/Thesis/Project/Seminar1) and [Seminar 2](https://github.com/aishameriane/msc-economics/tree/master/Thesis/Project/Seminar2) were presented during the "Seminários de dissertação e tese" course, in 2017/2.
