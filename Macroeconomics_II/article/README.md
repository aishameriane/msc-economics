# Description of the files

* [Descritivas](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aishameriane/msc-economics/blob/master/Macroeconomics_II/article/Descritivas.html) - Contains all the data gathering and insights. It contains more than I actually used for the final work, such an analysis of Brazil's interest rate (SELIC). The first version still contains some results from my first bvar, but I'll remove. I intend to add some stuff about inequality data there.

* [VARs](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aishameriane/msc-economics/blob/master/Macroeconomics_II/article/VARs.html) - Contains some model specifications I've tried and their respective results. Since running so many VARs is time consuming I just saved the main plots in images and attached to the markdown file. If you want to run, I suggest to run each model in separeted files (and preferably not using markdown). The model with more variables (5) took an average of 50 minutes to run in my not very good notebook).

_All codes and the final draft are in Portuguese._
