# Description of the files and directories:

* Descritivas (I'll upload a HTML file later) - Contains all the data gathering and insights. It contains more than I actually used for the final work, such an analysis of Brazil's interest rate (SELIC). The first version still contains some results from my first bvar, but I'll remove. I intend to add some stuff about inequality data there.

* [Tests](https://github.com/aishameriane/msc-economics/tree/master/Macroeconomics_II/article/Tests) - Contains some model specifications I've tried and their respective results. Since running so many VARs is time consuming I just saved the main plots in images and attached to the markdown files. If you want to run, I suggest to run each model in separated files (and preferably not using markdown). The model with more variables (5) took an average of 50 minutes to run in my not very good notebook). The model used is in VAR20.rmd. It generates 6 files with approx. 4.2gb each, so I advise against running it unless you have lots of RAM. I'll generate some html files and update the readme, when I have some spare time.

_All codes and the final draft are in Portuguese._
